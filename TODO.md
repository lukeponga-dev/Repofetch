# Task: Replace fetchRepos.js with AI-focused simplified version

## Information Gathered
- Current fetchRepos.js is comprehensive with error handling, data saving, detailed output, and fallback mechanisms
- User wants to replace it with a simplified version that:
  - Only fetches repositories using GitHub App
  - Filters for repositories containing 'ai' in the name
  - Displays them with a simple format using robot emoji
  - Has minimal error handling

## Plan
1. ✅ Backup current fetchRepos.js (rename to fetchRepos_backup.js)
2. ✅ Replace fetchRepos.js with the simplified AI-focused version
3. ✅ Test the new script to ensure it works correctly
4. ✅ Update README.md to reflect the changes

## Dependent Files to be edited
- ✅ fetchRepos.js (replaced content)
- ✅ README.md (updated to reflect simplified functionality)

## Followup steps
- ✅ Test the new script functionality
- ✅ Verify AI project filtering works correctly
- ✅ Ensure authentication still works with GitHub App

## Completion Status
All tasks completed successfully. The simplified AI-focused version is now in place.
